### Workshop Series: GitHub, GitHub Actions (with Quarto) and ShinyApps.io

This repository contains materials for the workshop series delivered to <>. See <> for rendered workshop materials.

The goal of this workshop is to highlight key ways to collaborate by giving attendees an overview of version control collaboration with [GitHub](https://github.com), a widely-used platform for hosting and sharing code repositories, automation with GitHub Actions, and reproducible and relialbe ShinyApps via ShinyApps.io. It does not go in depth into [git](https://git-scm.com) and more time could be spent on each of the topics.
